# Why is Gun Violence Decreasing in San Francisco and Oakland?

## Background

The goal of this project is to find what caused gun violence to decrease in the Bay Area while it was increasing in many other US cities for the past decade. Other [analysts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation) have suggested that this decline is related to criminal justice reforms, tough gun laws, and investment in local communities. We will be comparing how different cities in the United States interact with these factors using data from individual cities and comparing the differences.

The plan for this project is to have different individuals work separately on analyzing gun violence in different cities across the United States. At the end of the individual research, we will combine our findings together to compare what is and isnâ€™t working in reducing gun violence rates across America.

For example, my area of focus is currently on San Francisco and the Bay Area. My friend, [Erin Guetzloe](https://eringuetzloe.shinyapps.io/gun-violence-visualizations/) will be focusing on gun violence rates in Boston. After we both finish our invidiual research and have our findings, we will meet together and look at our findings together in order to come up with potential solutions and failures.

This collaborative project grew from the request of [David Hogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hogg_(activist)) Co-Founder of March For Our Lives and gun control advocate, to work with students of [David Kane's](https://davidkane.info/) Harvard Gov 1005 class. Hogg wanted to discover what specific factors had an effect in drastically decreasing the gun violence in the Bay Area and pinpoint specific examples of beneficial factors. One area of particular interest is in local initiatives that succeeded in the Bay Area. Any solid conclusions discovered at the end of this project will be used to try and lower gun violence in communities across the country.

Each dot represents at least one victim of gun violence from 2011 to 2017 in the two cities. I would like to emphasize that although this project includes many datapoints and numbers, real people are being affected by gun violence every day and that these numbers represent those people.

In this graph, I started my research searching for statistics on the number of gun violence crimes in different cities across America. This data was much more difficult to find than I originally thought because I learned that different police departments across the country all code incident reports differently. Some, like San Francisco's PD, had specific coding down to the level of homicides with different types of weapons. Other cities, like Oakland, coded reports much more vaguely with just homicides or gun violence. Instead, I resorted to looking at violent crime data from the FBI because all cities were required to report with similar coding. I found the [Data Commons Graph](https://browser.datacommons.org/gni) tool useful for this because it could combine the FBI data from many different cities into one for graphing. I chose the cities of Baltimore, Chicago, and St. Louis to compare because they are also other large cities in the US that are being affected by gun violence. One problem with this data was that it does not go as far back in years as I would have liked. However, 2011 to 2017 is still a good representation to look at the decrease in gun violence in San Francisco and Oakland that this project is focused on. 

```{r}
plot_ly(
            data = violence_capita,
            x = ~year, 
            y = ~deaths,
            color = ~cities,
            frame = ~frame,
            text = ~cities, 
            hoverinfo = "text",
            type = 'scatter',
            mode = 'lines',
            width = 1000, 
            height = 500
        ) %>% 
            layout(
                title = 'Number of Violent Crimes in Cities Per Year Per Capita',
                xaxis = list(
                    title = "Year",
                    zeroline = F
                ),
                yaxis = list(
                    title = "Violent Crimes Per Capita",
                    zeroline = F
                ),
                annotations = list(x = 1, y = -0.12, text = "Source: Census.gov, fbi.gov", 
                                   showarrow = F, xref='paper', yref='paper', 
                                   xanchor='right', yanchor='auto', xshift=0, yshift=0,
                                   font=list(size=15, color="black"))
            )
```

After looking at the graph created from the gun violence data, I realized that Chicago's high crime rate made it difficult to see the trends of all the cities. To clarify the trends, I took the crime rates and used the per capita normalization function in the [Data Commons Graph](https://browser.datacommons.org/gni) to show the number of violent crimes per capita. 

## Violent Crimes and California Imprisonment

```{r}
plot_ly(
            data = imprisonment_data,
            x = ~year, 
            y = ~numbers,
            color = ~variables,
            text = ~numbers, 
            hoverinfo = "text",
            type = 'scatter',
            mode = 'line',
            width = 1000, 
            height = 500
        ) %>% 
            layout(
                title = 'Violent Crimes and California Imprisonment vs. Year',
                xaxis = list(
                    title = "Year",
                    zeroline = F
                ),
                yaxis = list(
                    title = "Violent Crimes and Imprisonment",
                    zeroline = F
                ),
                annotations = list(x = 1, y = -0.08, text = "Source: Census.gov, fbi.gov, California Sentencing Institute", 
                                   showarrow = F, xref='paper', yref='paper', 
                                   xanchor='right', yanchor='auto', xshift=0, yshift=0,
                                   font=list(size=12, color="black"))
            )
```

Reading other reports on the low gun violence rates in California, there was a suggestion that this decrease related to a decrease in prison sentencing. While it was difficult to find sentencing rates specifically in San Francisco and Oakland, the overall imprisonment rates in California were available through the [California Sentencing Institute](http://casi.cjcj.org/about.html#download). What I found was a slight negative trend from 2011 to 2016, with the imprisonment rate following closely well to the Oakland gun violence rate. One problem with the imprisonment data is that most of San Francisco's imprisonment rates are not included because the California Sentencing Institute was unable to get the data from San Francisco.

                                 label = "Gun Control Laws"))))) %>% 
            layout(
                title = 'Regression of Violent Crimes and Gun Control Laws',
                xaxis = list(
                    title = "Year",
                    zeroline = F
                ),
                yaxis = list(

            )

The regression graphic shows the regression of three sets of data: the violent crime data from San Francisco, the violent crime data from Oakland, and the number of gun control laws in California. The violent crime data is the same that is shown in the first grpahic and the data on gun control laws is from [State Firearm Laws](http://www.statefirearmlaws.org/resources). The regressions show that over the years of 2011 to 2017, the number of violent crimes in San Francisco has actually had a slight increase, the number of violent crimes in Oakland had a slight decrease, and the number of gun control laws in California steadily rose. However, the violent crime rates of both San Francisco and Oakland both started decreasing from 2013 on and from 2012 to 2013, there was a slightly higher number of gun control laws passed, from 95 to 99. This suggests that one of those 4 new pieces of legislation might possibly have something to do with the decrease in gun violence in San Francisco and Oakland while it increased in many other US cities (as seen in the first two graphics). 

# Conclusions

## Thought Process

At the start of the whole project, I wanted to start by finding data to visualize and confirm that gun violence in San Francisco and Oakland. The closest data I could find at first was violent crime data, which I showed in my first two graphics under Violent Crimes. After that, I tried to find more data specifically relating to gun violence. As I mentioned before, The Trace had some very helpful datasets. However, these datasets were difficult to work with and in many cases just included too many variables that were not useful for my general graphic. I ended up using the Oakland data from The Trace and a big crime dataset with over 2 million rows from the City of San Francisco to plot datapoints with coordinates. I give a more in depth explanation about this process in my Methods tab under Gun Violence Datapoints. Confirming that there was a decrease in gun violence in these two cities from 2013 to 2017, I went to dig deeper into why. I started by looking at criminal justice reforms to see if if there was any connection between that and the decrease in gun violence. What I found was inconclusive, because there is very limited data on imprisonment and most of the data I found did not include San Francisco. I still created a graph showing the trend in violent crimes and imprisonment rates, but since San Francisco data was missing, I decided not to pursue any further there. Instead, I moved onto gun control legislation and that is where things got interesting. Looking at the regression model I made showing violent crimes and gun control laws in California, there appeared to a jump in four new gun control laws passed from 2012 to 2013 - exactly when violent crimes started decreasing in Oakland and San Francisco. Looking deeper into these four new laws, one had to do with ballistic fingerprinting and microstamping, two had to do with gun storage and child access, and one had to do with removing guns from people with a domestic violence-related restraining order. Cross-referencing back to other states that have implemented these same laws (especially looking at the states of the cities that showed an increase in violent crimes in my first two graphs) I found that the first three laws were also shared in states with increasing gun violence and the only one that only California had was removing guns from people with a domestic violence-related restraining order - identified as dvroremoval in the dataset. 

## dvroremoval

The first thing I did after realizing that this law was not as common in other states, I cleaned the data to create a graphic that would show which states did have this same law. The resulting graphic can be seen below. Massachusetts seemed to have adopted this piece of law back in 1994, long before California in 2013, Minnesota in 2014, and New Jersey in 2017. Looking at gun violence data in these other states, [Erin Guetzloe's](https://eringuetzloe.shinyapps.io/gun-violence-visualizations/) study on Boston, Massachusetts saw an increase in gun violence. However, they adopted this law much earlier in the 90s, so it may be an outdated law or other factors are causing an increase. In Minneapolis, Minnesota there is limited data on gun violence and I suggest further research into gun violence there. For New Jersey, the law is too new which leads to limited data. It would wise to keep track of gun violence rates in cities like Newark, New Jersey in the next few years.

                ggplot(aes(x = year, fill = state)) +
                geom_bar() +
                theme_classic() +
                theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
                      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
                      axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
                      axis.line.y = element_blank()) +
                labs(title = "States that have Adopted dvroremoval with Year",
                     x = "Year",
                     fill = "States"),
                width = 1000, 
                height = 500
                
        )
```

## Conclusion

While my findings may be inconclusive, there is simply not enough data to determine if dvroremoval laws were the leading cause of San Francisco's and Oakland's decrease in gun violence from 2013 to 2017. Each of these four implementations of dvroremoval might also vary between each other, leading some to be more effective than others. It does appear that California's implementation is much more specific than others as seen in [this](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/who-can-have-a-gun/domestic-violence-firearms/) article by Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. That being said, I strongly recommend keeping a tab on dvroremoval in the next few years and seeing its effects on gun violence in states that have implemented it. For further studies, I also recommend comparing how different states have implemented and are enforcing this piece of legislation. Contacting someone or an organization with more law background would be especially helpful in comparing these different implementations.
